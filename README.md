# About This Project 
The Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on understanding customer purchasing patterns during the Diwali festival season using real-world retail sales data. This analysis helps uncover valuable business insights such as:

* Which product categories perform best

* Which customer segments (age, gender, location) spend the most

* How demographic features affect purchasing behavior

The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Through charts and graphs, the notebook reveals key trends and actionable insights that can guide marketing and inventory decisions during festive sales.

This project is ideal for beginners in data analysis and provides a practical example of how to derive meaningful insights from raw sales data.
